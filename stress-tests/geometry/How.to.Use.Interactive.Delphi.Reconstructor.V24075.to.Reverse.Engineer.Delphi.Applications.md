# How to Use Interactive Delphi Reconstructor V2.4.0.75 to Reverse Engineer Delphi Applications
 
If you are a developer or a security researcher who wants to analyze, modify or debug Delphi applications, you may have encountered the challenge of dealing with obfuscated or encrypted code, missing debug information or complex algorithms. Fortunately, there is a tool that can help you overcome these obstacles and gain insight into the inner workings of Delphi programs: Interactive Delphi Reconstructor (IDR) V2.4.0.75.
 
## Interactive Delphi Reconstructor V2.4.0.75 (All Delphi Editions)

IDR is a powerful and user-friendly tool that can reconstruct the source code of Delphi applications from their binary files. It supports all Delphi editions from Delphi 1 to Delphi 10.4 Sydney, and can handle both 32-bit and 64-bit executables. IDR can also handle applications that use third-party components, libraries or frameworks, such as VCL, FireMonkey, DevExpress, UniDAC, FastReport and many more.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use IDR V2.4.0.75 to reverse engineer a sample Delphi application and explore its features and functionalities. We will also give you some tips and tricks on how to optimize your workflow and get the most out of IDR.
 
## Downloading and Installing IDR V2.4.0.75
 
The first step is to download and install IDR V2.4.0.75 on your computer. You can get it from the official website of the developer, CryptoCrack (https://cryptocrack.de/). The download link is located at the bottom of the page, under the "Download" section. You will need to register an account and log in to access the download link.
 
Once you have downloaded the ZIP file, extract it to a folder of your choice. You will see two subfolders: "Bin" and "Doc". The "Bin" folder contains the executable files of IDR and its plugins, while the "Doc" folder contains the documentation and help files.
 
To run IDR, simply double-click on the "IDR.exe" file in the "Bin" folder. You will see a splash screen with the logo and version number of IDR, followed by the main window of the program.
 
## Loading and Analyzing a Delphi Application
 
The next step is to load and analyze a Delphi application that you want to reverse engineer. For this tutorial, we will use a sample application called "Calculator.exe", which is a simple calculator program written in Delphi 10.4 Sydney.
 
To load the application, click on the "File" menu and select "Open". Navigate to the folder where you have saved the "Calculator.exe" file and open it. You will see a progress bar indicating the loading and analysis process.
 
When the analysis is completed, you will see a message box informing you about the results of the analysis. It will tell you the name, version and compiler of the application, as well as the number of forms, units, classes and methods that were reconstructed.
 
Click on "OK" to close the message box and proceed to the main window of IDR. You will see four tabs at the top: "Forms", "Units", "Classes" and "Methods". Each tab shows a list of items that were reconstructed from the application.
 
### Forms
 
The "Forms" tab shows a list of forms that were used in the application. A form is a graphical user interface (GUI) element that contains other controls, such as buttons, labels, text boxes, etc.
 
Each form has a name that starts with "TForm", followed by a number or a custom name given by the developer. For example, in our sample application, there are two forms: "TForm1" and "TFormAbout".
 
To view a form, simply double-click on its name in the list. You will see a new window that shows a preview of how the form looks like in the application.
 
You can also view the source code of the form by clicking on the "Code" button at the bottom of the window. You will see another window that shows the reconstructed Pascal code of the form.
 
The code consists of two sections: interface and implementation. The interface section declares the properties and methods of the form class, while the implementation
